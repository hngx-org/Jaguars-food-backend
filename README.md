### File Structure

- **Route**:  Where path of API endpoints are declared and assigned to controllers. 

- **Controllers**: Controllers will be responsible to handle all the incoming requests to your application which will either render a page in response, may send a JSON payload or will handle other critical API related actions like POST, PUT, DELETE. 

- **Config**: Keeps all the configs needed for the application. For example, if the app connects to a database, the config for the database can be put in a file like `db.config.js`

- **Index File**: This is the root file
